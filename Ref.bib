	abstract = {We consider steady-state production processes that produce a product and have feasibility constraints and metrics of cost and throughput that are stochastic functions of process controls. We propose an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for the problem of finding process controls that minimize the expectation of cost while satisfying deterministic feasibility constraints and stochastic steady state demand for the output product with a given high probability. The proposed algorithm is based on (1) a series of deterministic approximations to produce a candidate set of near-optimal control settings for the production process, and (2) stochastic simulations on the candidate set using optimal simulation budget allocation methods. We demonstrate the proposed  algorithm on a use case of a real-world heat-sink production process that involves contract suppliers and manufacturers as well as unit manufacturing processes of shearing, milling, drilling, and machining, and conduct an experimental study that shows that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms four popular simulation-based stochastic optimization algorithms.}

Under the uncertainty of demand, profit is maximized and opportunity loss is minimized. In real case, however, the demands of products are usually correlated. Hence, in this paper, a method is proposed for production planning optimization under the correlated and uncertainty demand. Correlated random numbers are introduced to Monte Carlo simulation to meet the real case. The production planning is multi-objective, thus genetic algorithm is employed. In order to search the optimal solutions effectively and efficiently, GENOCOP system is utilized to initialize population. The algorithm is tested on real data, and a wonderful performance is shown.},

The main idea of our approach is that the usefulness of rolling horizon methods is, to a great extent, implied by the fact that forecasting the future is a costly activity. We, therefore, consider a general, discrete-time, stochastic dynamic optimization problem in which the decision maker has the possibility to obtain information on the uncertain future at given cost. For this non-standard optimization problem with optimal stopping decisions, we develop a dynamic programming formulation. We treat both finite and infinite horizon cases. We also provide a careful interpretation of the dynamic programming equations and illustrate our results by a simple numerical example. Various generalizations are shown to be captured by straightforward modifications of our model.},

	abstract = {This article provides a review of models, analytical results and insights pertaining to multiple lotsizing in production to order, with emphasis on recent work on multistage systems and inspection issues. The basic setting consists of an order of fixed size that has to be met in its entirety. Production is in lots and is imperfect, and inspection can take place only when lot has completed a stage. Processing each lot at each stage entails fixed and variable costs. The tradeoff is between running large lots, entailing potentially costly overproduction, and small lots, which may necessitate multiple production runs and their associated setups. Variations of this problem have been explored since the 1950's, but only recently has there been significant progress in solving exactly problems of realistic complexity. We first review single-stage models, including those which compute the variance of costs, those dealing with inspections, those with multiple grades and situations with uncertain demand. We then review multi-stage systems, starting with those with no bottlenecks, and progressing to one, and two bottlenecks. The implications of rework capability in the various systems are then explored.},

The rate of change in machine states is much larger than the rate of fluctuation in demand and the rate of discounting of costs, and this gives rise to a limiting problem in which the stochastic machine availability is replaced by the equilibrium mean availability. The value function for the original problem converges to the value function of the limiting problem. Moreover, the control for the original problem can be constructed from the optimal controls of the limiting problem in a way which guarantees asymptotic optimality of the value function. The limiting problem is computationally more tractable and sometimes has a closed form solution.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a robust hierarchical production planning approach for a two-stage real world capacitated production system operating in an uncertain environment. The first stage of the system produces a set of semi-finished products having relatively stable annual demands, and the second finishing stage produces finished products having highly variable weekly demands. The fixed production setup costs incurred at the first stage are considerably high. Fixed production setup costs incurred at the second stage are fairly small compared to those of the first stage. We propose an integrated hierarchical planning model, where semi-finished products from the first stage (i.e. the aggregate level) are disaggregated into finished products to be produced in the second stage (i.e. the operational level). As a result of the relatively stable demands and the high setup costs experienced at the first stage, a cyclical aggregate planning model is proposed for production planning at the upper level of the hierarchical plan. Based on this aggregate plan, a modified periodic review policy is then proposed for production planning at the lower level. Finally, a coupling plan, linking the two planning levels, is proposed to ensure the feasibility of the disaggregation process at every period.},

	abstract = {Model Predictive Control is a well established technique for the control of processes and plants. We present a similar concept for planning and scheduling problems. There have mainly been two approaches to solve the planning and scheduling problems. The first approach is to model the planning and scheduling as one monolithic problem and solve it for the entire horizon. Needless to say, this approach requires an extensive computational effort and becomes impossible to solve in the case of large-scale scheduling problems. The other approach is to hierarchically-decompose the problem into a planning level problem and a scheduling level problem. This approach leads to tractable problems. Neither of these approaches provide the framework for incorporating uncertainties in the processing time of batches, or random equipment breakdowns, or demand uncertainties in the future. Furthermore, these approaches only provide ‘one snapshot’ of the planning problem and not a ‘walk through the timeline’. Model predictive planning and scheduling provides a framework for studying dynamics. Model predictive planning and scheduling requires a forecasting model and an optimization model. Both these models work in tandem in a simulation environment that incorporates uncertainty. The similarity with the model predictive approach which is widely used in process-control is that in each period, the forecasting model calculates the target inventory (controlled variable) in the future periods. These inventory levels ensure desired customer service level while minimizing average inventory. The scheduling model then tries to achieve these target inventory levels in the future periods by scheduling tasks (manipulated variables).},

Except for a few special cases, optimal solutions are computationally intractable for systems of realistic size. This paper proposes a novel approximation scheme using scenario-based model predictive control (SCMPC), based on recent results in scenario-based optimization. The presented SCMPC approach can handle supply chains with stochastic planning uncertainties from various sources (demands, lead times, prices, etc.) and of a very general nature (distributions, correlations, etc.). Moreover, it guarantees a specified customer service level, when applied in a rolling horizon fashion. At the same time, SCMPC is computationally efficient and able to tackle problems of a similar scale as manageable by deterministic optimization. For a large class of supply chain models, SCMPC may therefore offer substantial advantages over robust or stochastic optimization.},

Existing approaches for these problems are either restricted to deterministic environments or can only address a modest number of scenarios for the uncertain problem parameters. Our solution methodology integrates a recently proposed sampling strategy, the sample average approximation (SAA) scheme, with an accelerated Benders decomposition algorithm to quickly compute high quality solutions to large-scale stochastic supply chain design problems with a huge (potentially infinite) number of scenarios. A computational study involving two real supply chain networks are presented to highlight the significance of the stochastic model as well as the efficiency of the proposed solution strategy.},

Except for a few special cases, optimal solutions are computationally intractable for systems of realistic size. This paper proposes a novel approximation scheme using scenario-based model predictive control (SCMPC), based on recent results in scenario-based optimization. The presented SCMPC approach can handle supply chains with stochastic planning uncertainties from various sources (demands, lead times, prices, etc.) and of a very general nature (distributions, correlations, etc.). Moreover, it guarantees a specified customer service level, when applied in a rolling horizon fashion. At the same time, SCMPC is computationally efficient and able to tackle problems of a similar scale as manageable by deterministic optimization. For a large class of supply chain models, SCMPC may therefore offer substantial advantages over robust or stochastic optimization.},

In these models, uncertainty in demand is characterized via scenarios. Solutions are obtained for each scenario and then these individual scenario solutions are aggregated to yield an implementable non-anticipative policy. Such an approach makes it possible to model correlated and nonstationary demand as well as a variety of recourse decision types.For computational purposes, two alternative representations are proposed. A compact approach that is suitable for the Simplex method and a splitting variable approach that is suitable for the Interior Point Methods. A crash procedure that generates an advanced starting solution for the Simplex method is developed. Computational results are reported with both the representations. Although some of the models presented here are very large (over 25000 constraints and 75000 variables), our computational experience with these problems is quite encouraging.},

This problem arises, for example, in the integrated planning of locations and capacities of distribution centers (DCs), and the assignment of customers to the DCs, in supply chain applications. We consider the dynamic capacity acquisition and assignment problem in an environment where the assignment costs and the processing requirements for the tasks are uncertain. Using a scenario based approach, we develop a stochastic integer programming model for this problem. The highly non-convex nature of this model prevents the application of standard stochastic programming decomposition algorithms.

	abstract = {In this paper we consider a class of problems that determine production, inventory and work force levels for a firm in order to meet fluctuating demand requirements. A production planning problem arises because of the need to match, at the firm level, supply and demand efficiently. In practice, the two common approaches to counter demand uncertainties are (i) carrying a constant safety stock from period to period, and (ii) planning with a rolling horizon. Under the rolling horizon (or sequential) strategy the planning model is repeatedly solved, usually at the end of every time period, as new information becomes available and is used to update the model parameters. The costs associated with a rolling horizon strategy are hard to compute a priori because the solution of the model in any intermediate time period depends on the actual demands of the previous periods. In this paper we derive two a priori upper bounds on the costs for a class of production planning problems under the rolling horizon strategy. These upper bounds are derived by establishing correspondences between the rolling horizon problems and related deterministic programs. One of the upper bounds is obtained through Lagrangian relaxation of the service level constraint. We propose refinements to the non-Lagrangian bounds and present limited computational results. Extensions of the main results to the multiple item problems are also discussed. The results of this paper are intended to support production managers in estimating the production costs and value of demand information under a rolling horizon strategy.},

	abstract = {The existence of uncertainty influences the investment, production and pricing decision of firms. Therefore, capacity expansion models need to take into account uncertainty. This uncertainty may arise because of errors in the specification, statistical estimation of relationships and in the assumptions of exogenous variables. One such example is demand uncertainty. In this paper, a cautious capacity planning approach is described for solving problems in which robustness to likely errors is needed. The aim is to cast the problem in a deterministic framework and thereby avoid the complexities inherent in nonlinear stochastic formulations. We adopt a robust approach and minimize an augmented objective function that penalises the sensitivity of the objective function to various types of uncertainty. The robust or sensitivity approach is compared with Friedenfelds' equivalent deterministic demand method. Using numerical results from a large nonlinear programming capacity planning model, it is shown that as caution against demand uncertainty increases, the variance of the total objective function (profit) decreases. The cost of such robustness is a deterioration in the deterministic risky performance. This method is also applied to an industry simulation model in order to assess the effect of uncertainty in market demand on optimal capacity expansion and capacity utilisation.},

We study a firm producing multiple items in a multiperiod environment where demand for items is known but varies over time with a long-term growth and possible short-term fluctuations. The production equipment is characterized by significant changeover time between the production of different items. While demand growth is gradual, capacity additions are discrete. Therefore, periods immediately following a machine purchase are characterized by excess machine capacity. We develop a mathematical programming model and an effective solution approach to determine the optimal capacity acquisition, production and inventory decisions over time. Through a computational study, we show the effectiveness of the solution approach in terms of solution quality and investigate the impact of product variety, cost of capital, and other important parameters on the capacity and inventory decisions. The computational results bring out some key insights-increasing product variety may not result in excessive inventory and even a substantial increase in set-up times or holding costs may not increase the total cost over the horizon in a significant manner due to the ability to acquire additional capacity. We also provide solutions and insights to the real problem that motivated this work.},

	abstract = {A great deal of research has been done on capacity-constrained production–inventory systems, most of which concerns deterministic demand situations and single-product systems. In this paper we present a model of a multi-level capacity-constrained system when external demand is stochastic. Unlike the traditional total cost objective, adopted in the vast majority of capacity-constrained production–inventory models, the (expected) Net Present Value is here used as the objective function. Dynamic programming is chosen as the solution procedure. Numerical examples are given to explain the model and to illustrate features when changing available capacity.
	The Laplace transform together with input–output analysis are employed as tools to construct the model. This approach has been used in previous research to formulate a theoretical base for Material Requirements Planning (MRP) systems.
	The paper provides a further argument for the use of transforms in combination with matrix representations of product structures and capacity requirements, and it extends previous theory in the direction of capacity considerations combined with uncertainty in external demand. Dynamic programming is also shown to be a practical method for the multi-stage optimisation involved.
	The numerical examples further illustrate, for instance, the natural propensity for subordinate items to be lot sized in a more lumpy way than their parents, and also how the marginal benefit of capacity increments follows the law of diminishing returns. Also comparisons are made with solutions from the deterministic equivalence model, using average demand as a proxy.},

	abstract = {A great deal of research has been done on production planning and sourcing problems, most of which concern deterministic or stochastic demand and cost situations and single period systems. In this paper, we consider a new class of multi-period production planning and sourcing problem with credibility service levels, in which a manufacturer has a number of plants and subcontractors and has to meet the product demand according to the credibility service levels set by its customers. In the proposed problem, demands and costs are uncertain and assumed to be fuzzy variables with known possibility distributions. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total expected cost, including the expected value of the sum of the inventory holding and production cost in the planning horizon. Because the proposed problem is too complex to apply conventional optimization algorithms, we suggest an approximation approach (AA) to evaluate the objective function. After that, two algorithms are designed to solve the proposed production planning problem. The first is a PSO algorithm combining the AA, and the second is a hybrid PSO algorithm integrating the AA, neural network (NN) and PSO. Finally, one numerical example is provided to compare the effectiveness of the proposed two algorithms.},

The Hammersley Sequence Sampling (HSS) technique is used for updating discrete combinations, reducing the Markov chain length, determining the number of samples automatically, and embedding better confidence intervals of the samples. The improved algorithm, Hammersley stochastic annealing, can significantly improve computational efficiency over traditional stochastic programming methods. This new method can be a useful tool for large-scale combinatorial stochastic programming problems. A real-world case study involving solvent selection under uncertainty illustrates the usefulness of this new algorithm.},

Under a Quick Response system, lead times are shortened sufficiently to allow a greater portion of production to be scheduled in response to initial demand. We model and analyze the decisions required under Quick Response and give a method for estimating the demand probability distributions needed in our model. We applied these procedures with a major fashion skiwear firm and found that cost relative to the current informal response system was reduced by enough to increase profits by 60\%. Relative to the cost that would have been incurred if no response were used, optimized response reduces cost by enough to roughly quadruple profits.},

We first develop the methodology of this review and then descriptively analyze the sample. Subsequently, a content-related classification scheme for lot sizing models is developed, and the reviews contained in our sample are discussed in light of this classification scheme. Our analysis shows that various extensions of Harris' lot size model were developed over the years, such as lot sizing models that include multi-stage inventory systems, incentives, or productivity issues. The aims of our tertiary study are the following: firstly, it helps primary researchers to position their own work in the literature, to reproduce the development of different types of lot sizing problems, and to find starting points if they intend to work in a new research direction. Secondly, the study identifies several topics that offer opportunities for future secondary research.},
